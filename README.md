Don't you wish you could add functionality to UI controls without having to subclass them and do all kinds of complex stuff? You can with Xamarin.Forms Behaviors!

This repository contains sample code that shows you how to consume a behavior from the [XamarinCommunityToolkit](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit).

Watch how this repo was built and how to create Behaviors of your own, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKmj8Got_gE&list=PLfbOp004UaYUgjhTHjtSixo-iMdz6PhIv&index=1).
